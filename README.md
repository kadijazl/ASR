### Automatic Speech Recognition

Transcribe audio, summarise, detect 3R violations, offensive language, and perform sentiment analysis on the transcription.

Models used: OpenAI's Whisper (transcription) and GPT-4o-mini (text analysis).

PyAnnote is used for speaker diarization (https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1).

Deployed on a remote server.

This is an initiative project I worked on during my internship.
